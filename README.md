# The 2020 Review
A repository I made for my Computer Science Project, The 2020 Review, a "website" aimed to review disasters and miracles of 2020.

# Public Access
Though this is an individual project, I would appreciate anyone who would submit and add some new NEWS to the disasters and miracles section of my project. As much as possible, only change the text inside disasterData.js and miracleData.js, other files are meant to only be changeable by me.

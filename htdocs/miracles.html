				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p>Like the saying 'Every gray cloud has a silver lining', 2020 had some good things too, both in the physical world and in the virtual world. This page will recap all of these 'miracles' that occured during the entirety of 2020.</p>
				<p>(A majority of these miracles are mostly in the Virtual World, so things about social media and videogames are going to be here.)</p>

						Missed going outside? Nintendo has blessed us with its ever successful Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A video game where you get to buy a small island, and shape it the way your imagination decides. However, are you getting bored with too much peace, and you just want to go full on ape****? Bethesda released their ever amazing Doom Eternal in the same date. It is a sequel to game (Doom 2016) where you brutally murder demons. March was such a praised month in the video game community.

						While in this depressing quarantine, people realised that now with less responsibilities due to being stuck in their homes, they can develop amazing hobbies and things about themselves that didn't know about. Some developed art skills, some developed cooking skills, and some even found peace in their lives.

						Want to make and ruin friendships through the devious act of deceit? Then play Among Us. A video game where you play as bean-shaped scientist called 'Crewmates' doing science tasks. However, as you complete your tasks, one of the players is playing as an 'Imposter' who tries to kill all the crewmates. Finish all your tasks or loud and yell in a debate through voice chat with the other players to find the imposter in order to win the game.

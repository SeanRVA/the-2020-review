				<h1>Description</h1>
				<p>2020 didn't just get the name 'The Worst Year' for no reason. 2020 had so much disasters this year, that it is 80% the reason why this website was made. This page will mention every disaster in 2020. Starting with January.</p>

				<h1>Months</h1>
				<div id="inbox1">
					<h2>January</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						January started this year with a bang, literally. The US nearly started World War 3. Speaking of the US, Trump nearly gets impeached. Going east, Locusts have invaded Africa and caused a major problem. January is also the start of the Coronavirus Outbreak, however, this was not yet deemed a Pandemic. Taal volcano also erupted in the Philippines causing over 135,000 people to lose their homes and livestock. The Australian wildfires also started here. And of course, the tragic accident, Legend Kobe Bryant's Death.
					</div>
					<h2>February</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						February is a little less disastrous than January, this is the month when the Australian Wild Fires finally start catching the attention of many. This disaster was very problematic since it's western counterpart, Amazon Rainforest, was also still on fire (it still is by the way).
					</div>
					<h2>March</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Nothing much happened in March, except of course, the rise of the Coronavirus began. Due to it's shockingly quick  spread, scientists have officially deemed it as a Pandemic and warned many. However, by this time, it wasn't too big of a deal. Until next month...
					</div>
					<h2>April</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Finally it is here, the disaster that changed the lives of many, the disaster that created millions of conflicts, the disaster that chained us to our homes, that's right, it's CoViD-19. Because of it, self quarantining is now a must if you want to live. This disaster caused Extroverts to stay away from people, caused the weak to pass, and eventually cause the whole world, to lose hope.
					</div>
					<h2>May</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Chaos, chaos, and chaos. America is in such a big pickle now. May is the beginning of America's Riots. These riots being caused by different things: Racism, Police Brutality, and other stuff. It was such a mess. Italy also became the number 1 country with the most CoViD-19 patients. Oh, and the murder hornets were also invading America.
					</div>
					<h2>June</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Nothing much happened in June. Like really, not a lot of stuff happened. There was the locusts, but that was pretty brief. Oh, and America also stole Italy's role. Thats... pretty bad.
					</div>
					<h2>July</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Fortunately, nothing bad happened.
					</div>
					<h2>August</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Kim Jung Un was rumored to be dead. I hope not.
					</div>
					<h2>September</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						A volcano erupted in the Philippines. I guess that happened. Not much really happened.
					</div>
					<h2>October</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Burn! Burn! Burn! America's Wildfires. Apparently caused by Gender Reveals. For some reason, America is being oddly dangerous this year. It might be a sign.
					</div>
					<h2>November</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Not much of a disaster, but the US Elections started. America went wild that day.
					</div>
					<h2>December</h2>
					<div id="inbox2">
						Good news, December 32nd did not happen, but what did happen is the rise of CoViD-19 Variant (which I dub CoViD-20). Fortunately, that's really all that happened in December. We all survived 2020! Happy New Year!
